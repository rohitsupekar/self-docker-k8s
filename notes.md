Notes taken during Udemy course on [Docker and Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/). 

# Why Docker?

- Develop, build, test, deploy faster. 
- Allows packaging applications regardless of infrastructure, dependencies, OS, etc. 
- Maintenance is easier 
- Containers do not need re-writing code, so current applicaitons can be moved to containers 
- Container orchestration allows for reduction in VM costs 
- Open source 

# Installation 
- Two editions of Docker: CE (community edition; free) and EE (enterprise edition)
- Versions: "edge" is the beta version that comes out monthly; "stable" is well, stable!
- Mac doesn't natively support Docker (as yet), Docker app starts a VM in the background 
- There are docker versions specific to AWS/Azure/Google
- Download the mac version from the website, don't use brew :)
