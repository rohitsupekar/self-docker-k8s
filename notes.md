Notes taken during Udemy course on [Docker and Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/). 

# Why Docker?

- Develop, build, test, deploy faster. 
- Allows packaging applications regardless of infrastructure, dependencies, OS, etc. 
- Maintenance is easier 
- Containers do not need re-writing code, so current applicaitons can be moved to containers 
- Container orchestration allows for reduction in VM costs 
- Open source
